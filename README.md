## II. An introduction of this website

​	This website is for users to read and share news from all over the world.  Different from common news websites, in this website, news are classified by regions. Also, users can publish firsthand news they discover. Each piece of news has a *heat* value, which will also be shown. Others users can comment on news, either like or dislike, to increase or decrease the *heat* value. News with higher *heat* can be more easily recognized by users. In this way, really important news can be spread and those useless pieces of news will be buried.
